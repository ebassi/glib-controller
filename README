GController :: A Controller implementation for GLib data types
===============================================================================

The story so far...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a model-view-controller design, the current approach in GLib-based
libraries is to encapsulate the data structure used for storage and add
storage accessors that notify the view(s) of changes - thus conflating the
model and the controller sides into one data structure.

Encapsulation of storage and controller has invariably led to some issues:

  • data replication: unless the model is an interface that resides at a
    lower level in the dependency chain, and that can be bolted on top of
    an existing data storage, there has to be a copy from the simple data
    storage types provided by GLib (GArray, GList, GHashTable, etc.) into
    the model itself.

  • data access replication: be the model an interface or a base class,
    it requires the implementation of an API to access the data from the
    storage, including iteration over the data storage.

  • loss of performance/generality: if a model has to be accessible from
    higher levels of the platform stack, it has to lose every knowledge
    of data types, or re-implement them abstractly, incurring in a loss
    of performance; conversely, if it can be placed at higher levels of
    the stack, it will become tied to the view structure, losing
    generality.

These issues have been nominally approached by different libraries in
different ways - but always trying to maintain the model (data storage)
and the controller angles together.

GController: An alternative angle of attack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of collapsing both model and controller inside the same class it
should be possible to devise a way to use simple data structures already
provided by GLib for storage, access and iteration, and decouple the
controller into a separate class.
